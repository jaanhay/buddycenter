            **Pilot Project (2022-2023)**
            During the 2022-2023 pilot project, Buddy Center partnered with ZHEP and PMC School to support children with
            special needs. Here's an overview of the impact:
            **ZHEP:** Assisted 10 children with special needs.
            **PMC School:** Assisted 12 children with special needs.
            **Buddy Center:** Supported 4 underprivileged children with special needs at our Center.
            In total, 26 children received regular, tailored support, without any financial burden on the schools or
            parents. Buddy Center covered all costs related to staff and resources, ensuring these essential therapies
            were available to those in need.
